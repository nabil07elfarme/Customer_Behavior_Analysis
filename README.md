# Customer Behavior Analysis

## Customer Behavior Analysis with PySpark Data Wrangling and EDA

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Customer Behavior Analysis with PySpark_Data Wrangling and EDA.ipynb`) that demonstrates the process of analyzing customer behavior using PySpark. The notebook showcases various data wrangling techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods to gain insights into customer purchasing patterns.

### Introduction
Understanding customer behavior is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions and develop effective marketing strategies. PySpark, a powerful distributed computing framework, enables us to efficiently process large-scale customer data and extract valuable insights. This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to leverage PySpark for customer behavior analysis.

### Contents
1. Data Preparation and Loading:
   - Importing necessary libraries and initializing the SparkSession
   - Loading the customer data into a PySpark DataFrame
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   
2. Data Wrangling:
   - Feature engineering to create additional meaningful variables
   - Handling missing values and outliers
   - Applying transformations and aggregations to shape the data for analysis
   
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Conducting descriptive statistical analysis of customer variables
   - Visualizing customer behavior using charts, histograms, and box plots
   - Analyzing customer segments and demographics
   - Identifying popular products and purchasing patterns
   
### Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies:
- PySpark: The PySpark library should be installed and configured in your environment.
- Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook to run the notebook interactively.

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the notebook file (`Customer Behavior Analysis with PySpark_Data Wrangling and EDA.ipynb`) directly.

2. Set up the required environment with PySpark and Jupyter Notebook.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the notebook file (`Customer Behavior Analysis with PySpark_Data Wrangling and EDA.ipynb`).

Happy analyzing and understanding customer behavior using PySpark!
